# Midterm Project
This is the midterm project for LHL , the project goal is to determine the delay of flights for the month of January 2020, the link to download the data was provided by LHL and is on the Modeling.ipynb.
Data was extracted using SQL Alchemy, and data analysis and feature engineering are develop on the same file, this was a 4 days project and more work needs to be done in order to get better predictions, however it was a pretty good exercise to measure the advance from the beginning of the bootcamp to the midpoint.
